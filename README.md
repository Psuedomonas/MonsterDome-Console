Version 0.1.3 (3/17/21)

Development version

Changes:
* Separated monster.py to minutely simplify code.
* Added stamina to the monster object
* Added level to the monster object
* updated with changes from version 0.1.1.2

ToDo
* Adjust combat logic
* try object save/load instead of deconstructed save/load
* consider use case: redundant monster names
* try, except relevant user inputs

Other options
* add partial interface for save/load pen
* Add full interface... (like the unstable tk version)
