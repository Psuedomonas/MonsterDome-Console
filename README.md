Fight monsters in the battle dome
By Nicholas Zehm

Using Python3.10

## Updates
Version 0.2.2 stable (2023-01-18)
* fixed a number of logic bugs, including the lack of clearing list of
monsters for combat
* cleared some (not all) of unnecessary debug code

Version 0.2.1 experimental (2023-1-15)
* added ability to level up monsters

Version 0.2.0 experimental (2023-1-14)
* Due to features, I decided to name the stable version 2.0.
* Ability to bring more than 2 monsters to the battle dome and have them
fight. Currently no limit. Free for all mode only at the moment.
* Added defense and attack skill

Version 0.1.7 unstable/broken (2022-10-16)
* Add the ability to fight multiple monsters. This involves a complete
rewrite of the battle logic, which appeared to be much needed as 
unintended results may have occured in the previous version.

## Bugs
* none known, thought the interface is clunky

## Notes
* There are no notes

## Future directions
* more user control of monster combat
* team based fight mechanic
* a GUI of some kind
