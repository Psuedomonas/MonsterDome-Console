Version 0.1.1.2 (3/17/21)

This version works. Not protected from bad user input, but generally performs it function. 

Changes:
* added, then removed a debug toggle
* added some debug lines that are commented out be default
* cleaned up some stuff

Due to bug fixes upstream, I may delete this version...
